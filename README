Eventually this should be a proper README file with instructions and documentation.
For now it is just project notes.

To do items:
* Must fill out the Javadoc coverage!
* Figure out proper Hibernate annotations for classes and properties
* There is an issue with categories since the note categories are tightly coupled
  with the category lists in the main program
